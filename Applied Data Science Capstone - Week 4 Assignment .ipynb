From Hollywood to Silicon Valley, from Aerospace companies to giant Social Media companies it has everything an aspiring young person would love to enjoy. It has a diverse population that adds to fun when you are young. It is vibrant and feels like it has more economic ups and downs than the rest of the world. As you get older and start thinking about life after retirement you start to think of stability and familiar faces. As a resident of California, I and many of my friends and family wonder, what is the best County to retire? "
